Eldritch Investigators:

From the home screen, you can warp directly to any of the three HW assignments. Alternatively, you can click "Start Game" and you will go through the story in order with prelude screens. 

Hang-Man:

There is no initialization for the game, simply begin by pressing letter-keys on your keyboard and the game will evaluate the guess. If it is right, the letter will appear in it's correlating position in the Key-Word area. If it is wrong, a fire sound effect will trigger, the runes will begin to build, remaining guesses will decrease, and the guessed letter will appear in the Guessed Letters area. You cannot input any special characters or numbers, or duplicate a guess. 

If you guess all the characters correctly, a message will appear prompting you to either continue on to the next level, unlock more tomes, or return to the title screen. The name of the cult will always be whatever the first correctly guessed key word is. If you try to unlock more tomes, that message will not change. 
Alternatively, if your Remaining guesses reaches 0, and all the Runes have populated the screen, the current book will explode in flames and 1 of 2 messages will appear. If you failed the first time, it will tell you that you have no chance of following the cult, so you cannot proceed to the crystal game. If you either won or lost with the first Key-Word, any subsequent losses will show a different message.

Hint: By clicking on the eye icon in the journal, you can see a list of potential god names. 
Note: Due to the nature of the story, if you destroy the first book, you cannot proceed with the story. You can reset the game and continue to accrue Tomes Lost and Tomes Unlocked, but you will never be able to track down the cult (unless you refresh the page). Dont forget to hit the music Icon in the bottom left corner of the screen for all the games in Eldritch Investigators. 

Crystals:

Every time the page loads, the values of each crystal will be a random number between 3 and 10. It is possible that multiple crystals will have the same value.
By clicking on the crystals the crystal input will increase. Match the crystal input to the dimensional frequency to win. If the input goes over the frequency, attempts will increase and you start back at 0. You only have three attempts before you lose the game. 

Hint: you can cheat and console log the crystal values. 
Note: Given the nature of the randomization, there will certainly be instances where you cannot win, if that is the case, re-load the page and new values for the crystals and dimensional frequency will appear.
